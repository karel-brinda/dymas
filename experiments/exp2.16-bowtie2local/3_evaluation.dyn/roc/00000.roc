# Numbers of reads in several categories in dependence
# on the applied threshold on mapping quality q
# 
# Categories:
#        M: Mapped correctly.
#        w: Mapped to a wrong position.
#        m: Mapped but should be unmapped.
#        P: Multimapped.
#        U: Unmapped and should be unmapped.
#        u: Unmapped but should be mapped.
#        T: Thresholded correctly.
#        t: Thresholded incorrectly.
#        x: Unknown.
